# Student: Lohith Reddy Danda

## Project Overview

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Linear regression modeling for each axis  
- Residual analysis  
- Manual thresholding (MinC, MaxC, T)  
- Alert and error detection  
- Streaming simulation (row‑by‑row real‑time processing)  
- Event logging (start time, end time, duration)  
- Visualizations for model performance  
- Cloud database integration using Neon PostgreSQL

#  How to Run the Notebook

Start Jupyter:jupyter notebook

Open:notebooks/analysis.ipynb


Run all cells in order to reproduce:

- data cleaning  
- regression modeling  
- thresholding  
- alert/error detection  
- streaming simulation  
- event logging  
- SQL integration  
- visualizations

#  SQL Database Setup (Neon)



Create a `.env` file in the project root:
DB_USER=neondb_owner 
DB_PASS=your_password_here 
DB_HOST=your_host_here
DB_NAME=neondb


Ensure `.env` is **not** committed to GitHub.

Load environment variables in the notebook:

'''python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()'''
The notebook will automatically connect to your Neon PostgreSQL database.

# Project Workflow
- Load raw robot current data
- Clean and preprocess
- Fit linear regression models
- Compute residuals
- Apply MinC, MaxC, T thresholds
- Detect alerts and errors
- Simulate real‑time streaming
- Log events (start, end, duration)
- Store and load data from Neon SQL
- Generate visualizations

 # Results
- Regression models successfully captured expected current behavior
- Residuals revealed abnormal patterns
- Alerts and errors were detected correctly
- Streaming simulation behaved like a real robot controller
- Event logging captured accurate start/end times
- SQL integration worked smoothly
- Visualizations confirmed the anomaly detection pipeline

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete predictive maintenance pipeline for a multi‑axis robotic system. It includes data cleaning, regression modeling, thresholding, real‑time simulation, event logging, SQL integration, and visualizations. The system is fully reproducible and ready for deployment or further research.
